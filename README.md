Hello, I am Mayur Jangale, Welcome to my Github repository

This repository is dedicated to my academic projects related to Data Science. It includes projects that I have created to explore the fundamentals of Data Science and Machine Learning. The projects include regression, classification, clustering and case studies. I have used various data science libraries such as Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas and Seaborn to implement different models and analyse the data for the projects. This repository is a great resource to get an overview of the topics I have covered in my Data Science journey.

As below with python notebook links:
